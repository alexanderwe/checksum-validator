                <p>If you are trying to build Electron apps using React, or you just want to play around with them like me, feel free to use this seed as a starting point.</p>

                <p>
                    Pay attention lolollolololol to how everything inside src/ are bundled into build/, how global and scoped CSS work, how to compose React components, or simply how Webpack changes
                    relative image paths to public paths after building.
